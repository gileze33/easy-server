# EasyServer-Dev

Really lightweight wrapper around express to help you make a neat app from day one.

## Important
This is dev version of [`easy-server`]((https://github.com/urbanmassage/easy-server)) that hot-reloads controllers when they change.
It's not meant to be used in production environment.

Options are identical to `easy-server`, so you can check the documentation [here](https://github.com/urbanmassage/easy-server).
